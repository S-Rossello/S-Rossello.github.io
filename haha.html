Sorry this doesn't exist yet. It's my fault; truely and honestly it is. I'm lazy sometimes. Everyone is, but that won't stop it from being made soon. Chances are if you check here again in the future the page might be different! Probably not though. But not from lack of trying. Probably due to time constraints. I am a busy college student after all

As a side bar, I can't believe I scored so low on my Chem exam. I got a 70 percent that means I missed 6 questions. Only a few of them were stupid mistakes, which means I do need to study a bit harder in the future. I'm prepared to do that, I'm just incredibly worried that it's too late. I'm afraid that if I don't do well soon I'll lose my scholarship. I need to keep a 3.0 gpa, which doesn't seem difficult but I already have a 3.87, and that's with straight A's (One of them was an A- with a 93.8 percent, which is absolute BS). If I get 2 c's I'll still have a 3.2 but that isn't a lot of wiggle room. I hope I wont fail, because now there are real consequences. If I fail, I won't be able to afford college anymore. This is an awkward developmental point in my life, and I'm expected to have the forethought and capacity to react perfectly, or atleast close to perfect so that I can set myself up for the rest of my life. Maybe I can take loans, but noone wants to hire an engineer with below a 3.0. Maybe a school. Am I going to become a teacher? My mom would be furious.
