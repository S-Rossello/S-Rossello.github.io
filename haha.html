Wow, I've never really worked on anything like this, and that's scary. I love the idea of coding. HTML I've heard isn't really coding but
at the moment I'm not really concerning myself with that. I like Computer Science. Don't get me wrong, I like the IDEA of being a chemical engineer
but at the moment there really hasn't been something that has challenged me in a way that has been constructive to my mental. What I like about 
computer science is that there are these problems. They are assigned to me, and then I'm taught how to go about doing them. The most significant part to me isn't this though. It's the fact that I have the resources right now to just do whatever I want. I could learn how to do any problem in any way. My current struggles with Chemistry and those likes is that they offer me example problems. There is no creativity in the place where I'm at right now. And I know why this is. How could I not? It's because I need to learn the fundamentals before I can apply them to something else. These fundamentals are so defined that theres no other method to finding them. I'm not developing my own formulas. How can you? It's pressures and ratios and chemical equations! It's not something that has a lot of wiggle room. That's why I'm excited to improve and move on to new and more exciting frontiers!

Anyways, what did you guys want to do when you were a child? I don't know where I'm going with this thought but I was just reminded that I used to play the saxophone in middle school. Imagine if I had kept going with this? i don't really think there would be anything would happen of significance. Maybe I would be in the marching band though and that might be some fun.

I just thought about the bee movie

Sorry this doesn't exist yet. It's my fault; truely and honestly it is. I'm lazy sometimes. Everyone is, but that won't stop it from being made soon. Chances are if you check here again in the future the page might be different! Probably not though. But not from lack of trying. Probably due to time constraints. I am a busy college student after all As a side bar, I can't believe I scored so low on my Chem exam. I got a 70 percent that means I missed 6 questions. Only a few of them were stupid mistakes, which means I do need to study a bit harder in the future. I'm prepared to do that, I'm just incredibly worried that it's too late. I'm afraid that if I don't do well soon I'll lose my scholarship. I need to keep a 3.0 gpa, which doesn't seem difficult but I already have a 3.87, and that's with straight A's (One of them was an A- with a 93.8 percent, which is absolute BS). If I get 2 c's I'll still have a 3.2 but that isn't a lot of wiggle room. I hope I wont fail, because now there are real consequences. If I fail, I won't be able to afford college anymore. This is an awkward developmental point in my life, and I'm expected to have the forethought and capacity to react perfectly, or atleast close to perfect so that I can set myself up for the rest of my life. Maybe I can take loans, but noone wants to hire an engineer with below a 3.0. Maybe a school. Am I going to become a teacher? My mom would be furious.
